title: "Vibrational mode of MAPI"

My PhD regarded the study of the mighty MethylAmmonium Lead Iodide, MAPI for friends. A small organic cation trapped in an perovskite cage.

MAPI became famouse mostly because it works (check here on the [NREL CHART](http://www.nrel.gov/ncpv/images/efficiency_chart.jpg)). But when we say so, what we actually mean is, without fully understand how, in certain controlled condition, a very small solar cell can convert light into potential difference.

When we started we did not know much, and we performed different  *classic* DFT calculations to investigate the surprising properties of MAPI & Friends.

Nonetheless a big chunck of my work pointed away in the direction of the vibrational properties.
Thanks to the precious help of [Jonathan Skelton](https://github.com/JMSkelton) I dived into the magic world of vibrational properties using the amazing [PhonoPy](http://atztogo.github.io/phonopy/) written by Atsushi Togo(http://atztogo.github.io/)

We calculated different properties of MAPI and we finalised two papers on it:
