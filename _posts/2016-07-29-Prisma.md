**Caveat: most of what I will write here is purely arbitrary.** 

Art is the transmission of an idea with an aesthetic mean in a given context. Differently from science each person can have his own personal interpretation.
Some pieces of art represent powerful ideas that overcome the aesthetic appeareance. 
An example of this could be Guernica:

Others are extremely beautiful, but lack a strong message. I hope Jeff Koons does not take this personally:

Some artistic productions, instead, are exquisite technical exercises:

The whole value of this productions is given by their quality and the human appreciation in a specific historic moment.
Personally I can not say i prefer aesthetic over meaning, but I admit I particularly appreciate the technical side of art.
I admire objects I would not be able to reproduce, or conceive.

The above example are all paintings, but the same arguments can be extended to other artistic forms: sculpture, cinema, and ... photography.

They are human productions that joint together aestethic, technical skills in a precise context that results in art.


Before talking about Prisma, let me spend a couple of words on its parent Instagram.

I love Instagram. I hate Instagram. 
I love it because the _filters_ transform almost any pic in a good-looking appealing image.
I hate it because the _filters_ transform almost **any** pic in a good-looking appealing image. Even a random photo.

It is no photograpy anymore, it is a nice magic tool, that superimpose (or extract) beauty to an average photo.
Though the user has the possibility to pick the subject, the composition and to include a message in a pic.


To be completely honest another aspect that bugs me is that the final image are qualitatively poor. Small. Heavily compressed, and taken with poor tools.
(Even if your phone has 20MPx, it has superinteligent software and tons of commands, at the end of the day, it is a crappy small lens set that produce images that are good only if seen through a small phone screen.)
Still the filter magically return a good looking, unprintable nice pic.


And here it comes Prisma, the next Instagram. It looks similar to some early days photoshop effects, but it is totally different.
The images returned by Prisma, are not modified pictures. Are *ex-novo* pictures created by an Artificial Inteligence that lives in a neural network.
They look amazing.

But the user has even less power than in IG. It can still choose the topic, but the final result would be completelly **decided** by a computer.
Is for that reason anyhow uglier? No.

From a more practical  point of view it is an automatic dispenser of beauty.

I think the most important implications are of philosophical nature. Prisma is the first popular machine which can contemplate art. At the same time it destroys the concept of art, there is no more technical aspect, there is no more message, there is no more context. It is just beautiful. It performs on arts the same transforamtion fastfood did to food. Standardization and reproducibility of a good.


I hate Prisma. I love Prisma.
