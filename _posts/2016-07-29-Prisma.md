**Caveat: most of what I will write here is purely arbitrary.** 

Art is the transmission of an idea with an aesthetic mean in a given context. Differently from science each person can have his own personal interpretation.
Some pieces of art represent powerful ideas that overcome the aesthetic appeareance. 
An example of this could be Guernica:

Others are extremely beautiful, but lack a strong message. I hope Jeff Koons does not take this personally:

Others are exquisite technical exercise:

I can not say i prefer the aesthetic aspect over the meaning, and I appreciate the technical side of art. And the same argument can be extended to other artistic representation:sculpture, cinema, and ... photography.

Before talking about Prisma, let me spend a couple of words on its parent Instagram.

I love Instagram. I hate Instagram. 
I love it because the _filters_ transform almost any pic in a good-looking appealing image.
I hate it because the _filters_ transform almost **any** pic in a good-looking appealing image. Even a random photo. Even a photo taken without any technical consideration.
It is no photograpy anymore, it is a nice magic tool, that superimpose (or extract) beauty to an average photo.
Though the user  has the possibility to pick the subject, the composition and to include a message in a pic.

To be completely honest another aspect that bugs me is that the final image are qualitatively poor. Small. Heavily compressed, and taken with poor tools.
(Even if your phone has 20MPx, it has superinteligent software and tons of commands, at the end of the day, it is a crappy small lens set that produce images that are good only if seen through a small phone screen)
Still the filter magically return a good looking, unprintable nice pic.


Prisma is the next Instagram. It looks similar to some early days photoshop effects, but it is totally different.
The images returned by Prisma, are not modified pictures. Are EX-NOVO picture created by an Artificial Inteligence that lives in a neural network.
They look amazing.

But the user has even less power than in IG. It can still choose the topic, but the final result would be completelly **decided** by a computer.
Is for that reason anyhow uglier? No.
But it is the first step on a large scale of a machines that start to contemplate the concept of art. Basically it is an automatic dispenser of beauty.

I hate Prisma. I love Prisma.
