I am from a small town in province of Lecco, north Italy: [Robbiate](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbiate).
I completed a P.N.I. Maturita' scientifica at "Liceo Scientifico Maria Gaetana Agnesi". A part the school itself, spend a couple of minutes reading who was and what [Maria Gaetana Agnesi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Gaetana_Agnesi) did.
Her most notable work is the [Witch of Agnesi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_of_Agnesi):

More details are available [here](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=witch+agnesi).

After my degree I completed a Bachelor and Master degree in Scienza dei Materiali at [Milano Bicocca](www.unimib.it).
During the degree I spent some months with an Erasmus project at the Universidad de Barcelona.
